Console is a tool used to record the output of the JS programs.
  console.log("Hello!");

4 primitive data types:
  1) Strings (any grouping of keyword characters, with quotes '' or double quotes "")
  2) Numbers (any numbers, including decimals)
  3) Booleans (true or false)
  4) Nulls (only null, it represents absence of a value

Math operators:
  Add: +
  Subtract: -
  Multiply: *
  Divide: /

Properties
When I introduce a new piece of data into a JavaScript program, the browser saves it as an instance of the data type.
An instance is an individual case (or object) of a data type.

  For example: JS will save a new piece of data 'Hello' as a string instance in the computer's memory.
  Another example: Number 40.7 is stored as an instance of the number data type.
  An instance, like the string 'Hello' has an additional information attached to it - property.

  Example: .length property shows the number of characters in a string
  Example: console.log('Word'.length) -> the output is 4

Bult-in methods
  Length of a string is calculated when an instance is created, but string instance also has methods that calculate new information as needed.
  Built-in methods are called on an instance, they perform actions that generate an output.

Instance methods require an instance before you use them.
