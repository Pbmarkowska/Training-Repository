**2 types of script insertion:**
- inline script
- external script (js file)

**JS basics:**
- relatively simple syntax and features
- object-oriented programming language
- doesn't consume that much computer memory

**Modern Web Development:**
- HTML, CSS and JS based

HTML - content
CSS - presentation
JS - dynamic effects

**Variables:**
- Variable is a container to store a value
- To declare a variable we user ``var``

**5 different data types**
1. Number - floating point numbers, for decimals and integers (always decimal)
2. String - sequence of characters
3. Boolean - logical data types that can only be ``true`` or ``false``
4. Undefined - data type of a variable that does not have a value yet
5. Null - also means 'non-existent'

!! JS has dynamic typing - data types are automatically assigned to variables. 

**Rules for variables**
- cannot be named with numbers or symbols unless $ or _
- it's a good practice and convention to use camelCase
- cannot use reserved javascript reserved keywords

**Comments**
- single line comments starts with //
- multi line comments starts with /* and ends with /*

**Type coercion**
- JS automatically converts variables in order to join them
``console.log`` <br>
``alert`` <br>
``prompt``

**Basic operators:**
- Math operators
- Logical operators
- Typeof operator

**Operator precedence**: which operator is executed first <br>
**Associativity**: direction in which the operation is executed
